1. Watch the video presentation by Tamara Munzner: Keynote on Visualization Principles, https://vimeo.com/26205288 and slides - http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~tmm/talks/vizbi11/vizbi11.pdf Summarize the key take-home messages from her presentation.

I believe the major aim of the presentation is to point out that the option to use visualization should depend on the data available to you. When we have different types of data it is easier to visualize relationships and patterns between them by manipulating with the color, shape of the display value etc in order to bring actionable insights to the surface. There is a lot of power in using spatial position to analyze data as in almost every case it works out fine. An important point she also made was concerning "data transformation". Transforming the data into a suitable abstraction is needed in data visualization in order to represent data correctly.

In respect to 3D data visualization, one has to be cautious in this approach because important things could be easily missed (whereas avoidable anyways) and a good example of this is the fact that 3D does distort perspective.Taking a look at text legibility shows the extent to which 3D might be dangerous however 3D visualization is quite good (and mostly adviceable) for true 3D spatial data. Usage of 3D could result to important values from the data to be missing due to an overriding of the value by other values. In majority of the situation, it is easier to draw conclusions from 2-dimensional data visualization as opposed to 3-dimensional.


2. Fetch the UK child height/weight measurements data from here. (File).

Study a sufficiently large subset of measurements - plot dotplots comparing age, height, weight, BMI;

Experiment with color - highlighting gender, BMI clinical score, or age, by different markers, color or color scales.

(hint: you may want to develop ideas first with smaller subsets of data).

```{r, echo=FALSE}
uk_childData <- read.csv('C:/Users/Kenigbolo PC/Desktop/Data Mining/ncmp_1415_final_non_disclosive.csv')
childData <- uk_childData[,c(2, 3, 5, 8, 11)]


plot(x=childData$height, y=childData$ageinmonths, xlab ="Height", ylab ="Age in months" , main = "Age vs Height" , col=c("red","blue"))

plot(x=childData$weight, y=childData$ageinmonths, xlab ="Weight", ylab ="Age in months" , main = "Age vs Weight" , col=c("red","blue"))

plot(x=childData$bmi, y=childData$ageinmonths, xlab ="BMI", ylab ="Age in months" , main = "Age vs BMI" , col=c("red","blue"))

plot(x=childData$height, y=childData$weight, xlab ="Height", ylab ="Weight" , main = "Hieght vs weight" , col=c("green","orange"))

plot(x=childData$height, y=childData$bmi, xlab ="Height", ylab ="BMI" , main = "Hieght vs BMI" , col=c("green","orange"))

plot(x=childData$weight, y=childData$bmi, xlab ="Weight", ylab ="BMI" , main = "Wieght vs BMI" , col=c("cyan","orange"))
```



3. Derive new features to plot: height*weight ; height/weight; Body Surface Area ; Plot them against each other; and against BMI, height, or weight. Try to identify interesting meaningful trends or examples, provide some interpretation.

```{r}
#calculate the Body surface Area using Mosteller formular
childData$bsa <- sqrt((childData$weight*childData$height)/3600)
childData$genderdescription <- factor(childData$genderdescription)
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(childData, aes(height*weight, height/weight, color=genderdescription)) +stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="line")

ggplot(childData, aes(height*weight, bsa, color=genderdescription)) +geom_point()

ggplot(childData, aes(height/weight, bsa, color=genderdescription)) +stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="line")

ggplot(childData, aes(height*weight, bmi, color=genderdescription)) +stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="line")

ggplot(childData, aes(height/weight, bmi, color=genderdescription)) +stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="line")

ggplot(childData, aes(bsa, bmi, color=genderdescription)) +stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="line")

```
I subsetted a small chunk of the data that included the first 10,000 rows and exported it to excel where I calculated the height*weight, height/weight and Body surface Area and then imported the data back to try our some plots. For the calculation of the body surface area I took the Mosteller formular which calculates the BSA by multiplying the height and weight, dividing it by 3600 and finding the square root of the outcome. 

My observation is that the female children seem to grow a bit bigger and faster than the male hence there's a tendency that obesity will be more common in the female children than the male children.




4. Normalise height and weight based on the gender and age, repeat some of the plots from above.

```{r}
library('recommenderlab')
childData$normHeight <- scale(childData$height)
childData$normWeight <- scale(childData$weight)

childData$nHeightMulnWeight <- childData$normHeight*childData$normWeight
childData$nHeightDivnWeight <- childData$normHeight/childData$normWeight


plot(x=childData$nHeightMulnWeight, y=childData$nHeightDivnWeight, xlab ="Normalized Height * Normalized Weight" , ylab ="Normalized Height / Normalized Weight" , main = "Normalized (Height * Weight) vs Normalized (Height / Weight)" , col=c("red","blue"))



plot(x=childData$nHeightDivnWeight, y=childData$bsa, xlab ="Normalized Height * Normalized Weight" , ylab ="Body Surface Area" , main = "Normalized (Height * Weight) vs Body surface area" , col=c("red","blue"))

plot(x=childData$nHeightDivnWeight, y=childData$bsa, xlab ="Normalized Height / Normalized Weight" , ylab ="Body Surface Area" , main = "Normalized (Height / Weight) vs Body surface area" , col=c("red","blue"))



plot(x=childData$nHeightDivnWeight, y=childData$bmi, xlab ="Normalized Height / Normalized Weight" , ylab ="Body Mass Index" , main = "Normalized (Height / Weight) vs Body Mass Index" , col=c("red","blue"))

plot(x=childData$nHeightMulnWeight, y=childData$bmi, xlab ="Normalized Height * Normalized Weight" , ylab ="Body Mass Index" , main = "Normalized (Height * Weight) vs Body Mass Index" , col=c("red","blue"))



plot(x=childData$nHeightDivnWeight, y=childData$ageinmonths, xlab ="Normalized Height / Normalized Weight" , ylab ="Age in Months" , main = "Normalized (Height / Weight) vs Age in Months" , col=c("red","blue"))

plot(x=childData$nHeightMulnWeight, y=childData$ageinmonths, xlab ="Normalized Height * Normalized Weight" , ylab ="Age in Months" , main = "Normalized (Height * Weight) vs Age in Months" , col=c("red","blue"))



```



5. Draw approximate growth curves over age. Calculate and plot growth curves of the different deciles (0%-10%, 10%-20%, 20%-30%, ...90%-100%) of obesity categories both by BMI and by weight, for both genders.

```{r}

childData$genderdescription <- factor(childData$genderdescription)

library(nlme)
growth <- lme(height ~ ageinmonths, data=childData, random= ~ ageinmonths | genderdescription, method="ML")
print(summary(growth))





library(dplyr)

obesityByweight <- childData[,c(1,2,4)]
obesityByweight$quartile <- ntile(obesityByweight$weight, 10)
ggplot(obesityByweight, aes(ageinmonths, weight, color=quartile)) +stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="line")

obesityBybmi <- childData[,c(1,2,5)]
obesityBybmi$quartile <- ntile(obesityBybmi$bmi, 10)
ggplot(obesityBybmi, aes(ageinmonths, bmi, color=quartile)) +stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom="line")

plot(childData[,"ageinmonths"],childData[,"bmi"],  main="Growth curve for Age", xlab="Age in months", ylab="Body Mass Index")
plot(childData[,"ageinmonths"],log(childData[,"bmi"]),  main="Growth curve for Age", xlab="Age in months", ylab="Body Mass Index")

6. Attend the Tartu city open data event in the Garage48 hub on Saturday (March 5th, 2pm). Participate in some working group. Write a report about the ideas, problem statement, envision the goals of the project and main steps that need to be executed in order to achieve the stated goals.
