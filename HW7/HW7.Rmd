Use the data about transactions in a supermarket. Run FIM and Association rule generation algorithms to identify interesting itemsets and rules.

DATA file - Attach:supermarket.txt

1. Report which tools you decided to use, how you used them, what were the first results. Also report the running times for the tools chosen.

```{r}
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)

supermarketDF <- read.csv("C:/Users/Kenigbolo PC/Desktop/Data Mining/supermarket.txt", header = F, sep = " ")


supermarket <- read.transactions("C:/Users/Kenigbolo PC/Desktop/Data Mining/supermarket.txt", format = "basket", sep=" ")

print(system.time(supermarket <- read.transactions("C:/Users/Kenigbolo PC/Desktop/Data Mining/supermarket.txt", format = "basket", sep=" ")))

rules <- apriori(supermarket, parameter = list(minlen=2, supp=0.003, conf=0.8), control = list(verbose=F))

inspect(rules)

print(system.time(apriori(supermarket, parameter = list(minlen=2, supp=0.003, conf=0.8), control = list(verbose=F))))

```

Tools Used
=> I used the Arules and ArulezViz library in R
```{r}
library(arules)
library(arulesViz)
```

How Tools were used 
=> First I loaded the data into R by reading it in via "read.transactions"
=> Then I tried to inspect the taransactions by calling the "inspect()" method on the supermarket transaction values but there were so many of them
=> Later used the inspect to check the rules
=> Continuation of how tools were used can be seen in the first results and execution times sub sections
```{r}
supermarket <- read.transactions("C:/Users/Kenigbolo PC/Desktop/Data Mining/supermarket.txt", format = "basket", sep=" ")
```

First results
The first results obtained are the following
=> First I ran the apriori algorithm provided by the arules package and I used a support of 0.002 and this gave me about 120 rules which was obviously a whole lot 
=> I ran the apriori algorithm a second time and increased the support to 0.003 and this produced 48 rules which is what I settled for as this tasks as this was quite reasonable for this first task in my opinion albeit 0.002 should be more suitable for the next task.
=> I proceeded to do a scatter plot for the rules that plotted confidence against support using lift as the gauge
=> I also explored plotting a Graph for 48 rules which in my opinion wasn't really clear enough which made me to proceed by
=> Plotting parallel coordinates plot for the 48 rules. At this point I realized the graphs weren't really interepretable so I adjusted my support a bit. 
```{r}
rules <- apriori(supermarket, parameter = list(minlen=2, supp=0.002, conf=0.8), control = list(verbose=F))
inspect(rules)
rules <- apriori(supermarket, parameter = list(minlen=2, supp=0.003, conf=0.8), control = list(verbose=F))
inspect(rules)

plot(rules)

plot(rules, method="graph", control=list(type="items"))


plot(rules, method="paracoord", control=list(reorder=TRUE))
```

=> I increased support to 0.004 in order to get a clearer picture and plots that are a bit understandable and this reduced my rules further to 24
```{r}
rules <- apriori(supermarket, parameter = list(minlen=2, supp=0.004, conf=0.8), control = list(verbose=F))
inspect(rules)
```

=> I further increased support to 0.005 in order to to see what the rule distribution will be like and I got 12 rules.
=> At this point it made sense to make plots again which I did by making a scatter plot and I noticed that majority of the rules had thier support between 0.006 and 0.008 and lift was high when support was <= 0.006
=> I plotted the graph for 12 rules and the distribution gave me a clear view of the most frequent items
=> The parallel coordiates plot gave an interesting insight for 14482 as the arrow had a dissimilar direction wen compared to the other items
```{r}
rules <- apriori(supermarket, parameter = list(minlen=2, supp=0.005, conf=0.8), control = list(verbose=F))
inspect(rules)

plot(rules)

plot(rules, method="graph", control=list(type="items"))

plot(rules, method="paracoord", control=list(reorder=TRUE))
```


=> Finally I decided to do a frequency plot for all items with a support of at least 0.035 in the data in order to enable me to compare about 15 items and identify which of those items had quite high frequency
```{r}
itemFrequencyPlot(supermarket, support = 0.035, cex.names=0.8)
```


Running time for chosen tool
=> The running time of reading in the data itself is as follows
       user   system    elapsed 
       4.86     0.00       4.86 
       
       
```{r}
print(system.time(supermarket <- read.transactions("C:/Users/Kenigbolo PC/Desktop/Data Mining/supermarket.txt", format = "basket", sep=" ")))
```
=> The running time for the rules is as follows
       user   system    elapsed 
       0.16     0.00       0.16 
```{r}
print(system.time(apriori(supermarket, parameter = list(minlen=2, supp=0.003, conf=0.8), control = list(verbose=F))))
```

2. Report overall 5 different high-support, high-confidence, high-lift rules; provide the respective contingency tables and scores.

High Support - Top 5
```{r}
## Mine frequent rules with top support
top.support <- sort(rules, decreasing = TRUE, na.last = NA, by = "support")

## Display the 10 rules with the highest support.
inspect(head(top.support, 5))

```

High Confidence - Top 10
```{r}
## Mine frequent rules with top confidence.
top.confidence <- sort(rules, decreasing = TRUE, na.last = NA, by = "confidence")

## Display the 10 itemsets with the highest confidence.
inspect(head(top.confidence, 5))
```

High Lift - Top 10
```{r}
## Mine frequent rules with top lift.
top.lift <- sort(rules, decreasing = TRUE, na.last = NA, by = "lift")

## Display the 10 itemsets with the highest lift.
inspect(head(top.lift, 5))
```

The respective contingency tables
```{r}

rules <- apriori(supermarket, parameter = list(minlen=2, supp=0.005, conf=0.8), control = list(verbose=F))
cont_table <- inspect(rules)

#Outline Rules for contingency table
print(cont_table)

library(dplyr)

#Filter for all items present in the rules from Supermarket.txt 
#rulesDF <- filter(supermarketDF, V1 == "9630" |V1 == "13973"|V1 == "13491"| V1 == "5330"| V1 == "7466"|V1 == "2449"|V1 == #"12456"|V1 == "14914"|V1 == "12562"| V1 == "9108"|V1 == "14482"|V1 == "6385"|V1 == "14754"|V1 == "11995")
```

Contigency Tables
From filtering the data the following values will be sieved out F11, F1+, F+1 and TOTAL. The rest values will to be calculated will be done as stated below

F10 = F1+ - F11
F01 = F+1 - F11
F0+ = TOTAL - F1+
F+0 = TOTAL - F+1
F00 = F+0 - F10

The contigency table for the rules is generatted by getting all the transactions where 9630 is present which is 31, where 13973 is present which is 242 and where both 9630 and 13973 are present which is 28. The total number of the observables for the dataframe of the the supermarket.txt is 32560 observables.

3. Discuss whether some other scores studied last week or in the lecture slides would help identify "more interesting" and different rules?


I believe the Odds ratios (f11.f00)/(f10.f01) will help identify more interesting and different rules because Odds ratios are used to compare the relative odds of the occurrence of the outcome of interestingness, given exposure to the variable of interest. It is a way to quantify how strongly the presence or absence of an item (e.g. 5330) is associated with the presence or absence of another item (e.g. 12456) in the supermarket.txt dataset


4. Given the ability to discover frequent itemsets and association rules, propose a strategy to use these tools to study different customer segments, shops, shopping times, or specific products.

Proposing a strategy will depend to a large extent on the labels of the data however the first step will be to find the frequency of products in the data set after which we match the frequency of the products in each shop. It will be sensible that after matching the frequency of the products in each shop we check out the times when these products were bought in each shop. We can also mine for the different times some specific products (with high frequency) were bought in shops. For the customer segment it will then make sense to mine the frequent item sets in order to understand what group of items were bought (This should give us an idea of the different types of customers). Furthermore we can also mine for which combinations were bought more in the shops. 

5. Select some relatively high-support high-confidence rule (A->B) and based on that example describe the conditional probabilities P(A|B) and P(B|A), as well as the Bayes rule.


From my top 5 high confidence and high support, the rule with the highest confidence and support is 

lhs         rhs       support     confidence    lift 
{12456} => {5330}   0.007012844   1.0000000     5.119403

Considering the above let A = lhs and B = rhs hence
A = 12456
B = 5330


Analyzing the contingency table for the rule "RULE 12456 => 5330"
```{r}
#Filter the Rules Dataframe for where the item 12456 is present
subset12456 <- filter(supermarketDF, V1 == "12456" | V2 == "12456" | V3 == "12456" |V4 == "12456" |V5 == "12456" |V6 == "12456" |V7 == "12456" |V8 == "12456" |V9 == "12456" |V10 == "12456" |V11 == "12456" )

#Total number of observables where
nrow(subset12456)

#Filter the Rules Dataframe for where the item 12456 and 5330 are present
subset12456_5330 <- filter(subset5330, V1 == "12456" | V2 == "12456" | V3 == "12456" |V4 == "12456" |V5 == "12456" |V6 == "12456" |V7 == "12456" |V8 == "12456" |V9 == "12456" |V10 == "12456" |V11 == "12456" )

#Total number of observables where
nrow(subset12456_5330)


#Initialize the contingency table
contigencyTable <- matrix(c(86,92,178,4872,27510,32382,4958,27602,32560),ncol=3,byrow=TRUE)
colnames(contigencyTable) <- c("5330","NOT 5330","TOTAL")
rownames(contigencyTable) <- c("12456","NOT 12456","TOTAL")

print(contigencyTable)
```

To calcultae p(A)
P(A) = n(A)/n(S)
where n(A) refers to number of A present 
n(A) == n(12456)

where n(S) total number in Sample space
n(S) == n(Total)

From Contingency table 
n(12456) = 178

n(Total) = 32560

p(12456) = 178/32560
p(12456) = 0.00546683


To calcultae p(B)
P(B) = n(B)/n(S)
where n(B) refers to number of B present 
n(B) == n(5330)

where n(S) total number in Sample space
n(S) == n(Total)

From Contingency table 
n(5330) = 4958

n(Total) = 32560

p(5330) = 4958/32560
p(5330) = 0.1522727


Now from the contingency table we have N(AnB) = 86

P(AnB) = n(AnB)/n(S)
P(12456n5330) = 86/32560
P(12456n5330) = 0.002641278

Now we can calculate for P(A|B) and P(B|A)

P(A|B) = P(AnB)/P(B)
       = 0.002641278/0.1522727
       = 0.01734571

P(B|A) = P(AnB)/P(A)
       = 0.002641278/0.00546683
       = 0.4831462
       
       
Using the Bayes Rule P(A|B) = (P(B|A)P(A))/P(B)

Hence for Bayes Rule
Have gotten the following

P(B|A) = 0.4831462
P(A)   = 0.00546683
P(B)   = 0.1522727

P(A|B) = (0.4831462*0.00546683)/0.1522727
       = 0.01734571
       
       
From the above we can see that my earlier values for P(A|B) calculated without using the bayes rule corresponds with the P(A|B) using the Bayes rule
