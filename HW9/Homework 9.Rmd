This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

roctrue <- read.table("C:/Users/Kenigbolo PC/Desktop/Data Mining/HomeWorks/HW9/roc/data.class")
roc1 <- read.csv("C:/Users/Kenigbolo PC/Desktop/Data Mining/HomeWorks/HW9/roc/roc1/roc0.9.csv")


checkfunction(roctrue, roc1)

checkfunction <- function(a, b) {
  a$class <- "Actual"
  b$class <- "Predicted"
  
  check <- rbind(a, b)
  dupRows <- dupsBetweenGroups(check, "class")
  sec_check <- cbind(check, dup=dupRows)
  third_check <- subset(sec_check, dup == "TRUE")
  fourth_check <- subset(third_check, class == "Actual")
  tp <- subset(fourth_check, V2 == "TRUE")
  tn <- subset(fourth_check, V2 == "FALSE")
  print("True positive values are: ")
  print(nrow(tp))
  print("True negative values are: ")
  print(nrow(tn))
  
}

checkfunction(roctrue, roc1)

```

Dups between group function

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#dupsBetweenGroups function gotten from http://www.cookbook-r.com/Manipulating_data/Comparing_data_frames/

dupsBetweenGroups <- function (df, idcol) {
    # df: the data frame
    # idcol: the column which identifies the group each row belongs to

    # Get the data columns to use for finding matches
    datacols <- setdiff(names(df), idcol)

    # Sort by idcol, then datacols. Save order so we can undo the sorting later.
    sortorder <- do.call(order, df)
    df <- df[sortorder,]

    # Find duplicates within each id group (first copy not marked)
    dupWithin <- duplicated(df)

    # With duplicates within each group filtered out, find duplicates between groups. 
    # Need to scan up and down with duplicated() because first copy is not marked.
    dupBetween = rep(NA, nrow(df))
    dupBetween[!dupWithin] <- duplicated(df[!dupWithin,datacols])
    dupBetween[!dupWithin] <- duplicated(df[!dupWithin,datacols], fromLast=TRUE) | dupBetween[!dupWithin]

    # ============= Replace NA's with previous non-NA value ==============
    # This is why we sorted earlier - it was necessary to do this part efficiently

    # Get indexes of non-NA's
    goodIdx <- !is.na(dupBetween)

    # These are the non-NA values from x only
    # Add a leading NA for later use when we index into this vector
    goodVals <- c(NA, dupBetween[goodIdx])

    # Fill the indices of the output vector with the indices pulled from
    # these offsets of goodVals. Add 1 to avoid indexing to zero.
    fillIdx <- cumsum(goodIdx)+1

    # The original vector, now with gaps filled
    dupBetween <- goodVals[fillIdx]

    # Undo the original sort
    dupBetween[sortorder] <- dupBetween

    # Return the vector of which entries are duplicated across groups
    return(dupBetween)
}
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
